# Focus music extention

> In this new tech world, distractions are everywhere and for some reason many of us nowdays can focus better with some music background rather than random disturbing sounds from envoirnment, Thus i got the idea to create this extention

## Aim
To create a Helpful extention for your browser that Plays music in background whenever you open it, to **retain focus** and avoid distractions & __temptaion to switch tabs__

## Features
- __🎵  playing a LoFi livestreem in background__
- 🤯 `AUTO PAUSING` if user play some media
- 🌊 `Autoplay` on tab opening
- 🍀 `Background play` to not add another tab to your browser
- ⚙️ `Full controls` over music and pause and play
- ⏯️ `ability to change` the music

> I intend to improve and fix it and make it accessible more in future

## Setup
1. Fork and download the project
2. Click on extentions > manage extention > `load unpack extention` 
3. Select `app` file in the project

### Once Setup, wait for it to load and it should start autoplaying

## Credits
currently I am only one working on this
