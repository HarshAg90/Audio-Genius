# Focus music extention

### background
In this new tech world, distractions are everywhere and for some reason many of us nowdays can focus better with some music background rather than random disturbing sounds from envoirnment, Thus i got the idea to create this extention

## Aim
___i hope to create a Helpful extention for your browser so that whenever you open it,it autoplays some music to `keep u engaged in work` and to `not get bored` and `tempted to switch`___

## Features
This is still in progress but current case is 
__playing a LoFi livestreem in background__
- `AUTO PAUSING` if user play some media
- `Autoplay` on tab opening
- `Background play` to not add another tab to your browser
- `Full controls` over music and pause and play
- `ability to change` the music

## Credits
currently I am only one working on this
